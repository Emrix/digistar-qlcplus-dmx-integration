# digistar-qlcplus-dmx-integration
This is a simple Python script that will interface the [E&amp;S Digistar Software](https://www.es.com) with [QLC+](https://www.qlcplus.org) lighting control software.

The setup instructions should be in the DMX.py file.

Please remember that if you do decide to use QLC+, to donate to the project!

This project was initially created for use at the [Planetarium at the Christa McAullife Space Center](https://spacecenter.alpineschools.org/planetarium/) in Pleasant Grove, Utah
